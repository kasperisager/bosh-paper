\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Over the course of this project we have successfully implemented a minimal Unix shell in C with all required functionality including, but not limited to, process redirects, file redirects, and backgrounding. The shell is compilable on both macOS and Linux and we have additionally ensured that it has no external dependencies such as the Readline library.

While there is still room for improvement, we believe that our implementation of Bosh is a fairly solid one. An interesting future improvement would be to implement variable and path expansion in the same vein as seen in Bash.
